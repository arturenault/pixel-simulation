Beings
	Attributes
		Valence
			There are N/(something) of these at first; beings will fight those they like and breed with the ones they dislike.
		Strength (Red)
			Determines resistance to diseases and strength in fights. Decreases over time.
		Fertility (Green)
			If next to other being for a while, the lowest of the two fertilities defines threshold for random draw. If drawn below,
		Creativity (Blue)
			Acts as an added bonus to any draw. Grows over time in periods of survival.

	Actions
		Reproduction
			If next to another being with the same valence for a while (tbd), roll fertility from the less fertile being to spawn a new being with the same valence, and a normal distribution draw from the other three attributes, with the mean being the average of the two, and the standard deviation being the separation of the two from the mean.
		Battle
			If meet a being with a different valence, fight them. Both beings roll strength, and the being with the highest roll damages the other for that value.

Land 
	Attributes
		Hostility
			Defines probability of dying from diseases (need to find a good random way of distributing this continuously and randomly. potentially generate bodies of "water" and then increase hostility from there?)
